-> Add 3 implementations for scheduler
1)<<current>> Priority Queue with all jobs, 
always check when the peek job scheduled time comes, 
Execute job in a separate thread and add the job with the new scheduled time to the queue again.
2)Every job added has a thread from the beginning and the thread sleeps till the next execution time.
3)Applying "Observer" pattern let the scheduler sleep till the nearest job scheduled time
If a new job is added, notify the scheduler to recalculate the remaining time till the nearest job.
---------------------------------------------------
-> Use Logger
---------------------------------------------------
-> Add Interfaces
---------------------------------------------------
-> Add Scheduler Factory
---------------------------------------------------
->Add 2 types of JobSchedule
1)<<current>> "Delay Job" with initial delay and interval between each job
2)"Rate Job" that has specific Date/Time to execute with 
-frequency(Daily/hourly/..)
-atTime - atDay - atMonth -atYear

can have an abstract class and both inherits it
----------------------------------------------------
->Use Locks 
----------------------------------------------------
->Save history of scheduler and jobs and export it to text file
----------------------------------------------------
-> Allow recover of scheduler from failure using history
-----------------------------------------------------
-> Add class diagram
-----------------------------------------------------
-> Add Test Coverage
-------------------------------------------------------
